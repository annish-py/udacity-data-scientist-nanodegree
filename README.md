This is a repository for my Data Scientist Nano Degree Projects.

Here is a brief description of the projects involved with this programme.

   - In this project, I chose last 5 years survey from the kaggle dataset [Stack Overflow Survey Data 2016-2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) to identify the trends and responses of the developer community and tried to analyze and derive insights with visualizations for the scenarios,
1. Countries with the most no. of developers in the last 5 Years
2. Most popular languages for developer community in the last 5 years
3. Multivariate plot for understanding the relationship between age and compensation of the developers
4. Data exploration of some of the common categorical responses of the survey
5. Understanding the Health and Lifestyle trends among the developers
