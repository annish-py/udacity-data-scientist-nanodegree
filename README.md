## Project Motivation <a name="ProjectMotivation"></a>
 - Write a Data Science Blog Post:
   - In this project, I chose last 5 years survey from the data-set [Stack Overflow Survey Data 2016-2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey) to identify the trends and responses of the developer community and tried to analyze and derive insights with visualizations for the scenarios,
1. Which are the top 5 countries with the most no. of developers in the last 5 Years (2016-2020)?
2. Which are the top 5 most popular language trends among the developer community in the last 5 years (2016-2020)?
3. What is the relationship between age and compensation of the developers across the various gender categories?
4. What are the responses of some of the common categorical questions in the survey?
5. What are the health and food habit trends among the developer's lifestyle?

This project follows the CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining) and the detailed sections and information pertaining to the same can be found in the jupyter notebook file.
